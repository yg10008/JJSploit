## ✅ Goals of This Repository

- Master **real-world Python scripting** with purpose  
- Use **API, logging, data modeling** in hands-on ways  
- Build and deploy **mini CLI apps, analysis scripts, log systems**

---

## 📌 Skills Practiced

- Python fundamentals, OOP, modular design  
- Logging & error handling  
- JSON parsing, REST API integration  
- Data manipulation with `pandas`, `numpy`  
- Visualization with `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- Outlier detection & statistical preprocessing  
- CLI-based user input handling

## 💡 What’s Next?

- [ ] Move to full data classification and anomaly detection  
- [ ] Integrate real log datasets for AI-based analysis  
- [ ] Fuse Cyber logic with ML models for phishing, malware, spoof detection
